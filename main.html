	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
  <p>
    I want to become a software developer because I enjoy solving problems and building things that can help people. The idea of writing code that brings ideas to life excites me, and the ever-evolving nature of technology keeps me motivated to keep learning. Software development combines creativity with logic, and that perfect balance makes it the ideal career path for me.
